# Automatic Nerf Gun using a Rapsberry Pi

What you'll need:
* Nerf Revelle Rapid Red Blaster - <$12 on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Nerf-Rebelle-Rapid-Red-Blaster/dp/B00INZO30M/ref=sr_1_2?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1496580017&sr=1-2&keywords=nerf+rebelle)
* Raspberry Pi with one of the PCM GPIO pins available
* Relay switch for the Raspberry Pi - I have an odd setup from an existing project so I don't discuss this
* Access to a 3D Printer - you can use an online service
* Some 18 to 22 guage wire
* Appropriate jumper pins or a breakout board for the pi
